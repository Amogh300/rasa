    <h1>Entity Extraction</h1>
    <p>Inside the nlu.yml file we have to give an example of how an entity value will be given by the user.</p>
    <p>List all entities in domain.yml file.</p>
    <p>Entity cannot be extracted directly. We have to declare the intents properly inside the domain.yml file.</p>
    <p>We can have two things use_entites and ignore_entities. We use use_entities for catching entties which, and ignore_entities for entites which are not useful for us.</p>
    <p>Inside the story, wherever we have the intent which has an entity associated with it we need to specify the name of the entity as well as an example of the entity value.</p>

    <h1>Slot Values</h1>
    <p>After extracting the entites, we have to store them inside slots</p>
    <p>Slots are declared inside stories, and also the type of the slot value is declared inside the variable.</p>
    <p>We need to write  slot variables inside the stories file as well.</p>
